# Image Captioning Project

This project uses deep learning (CNN + LSTM) to generate captions for images using the Flickr8k dataset and InceptionV3 feature extraction.

## Files
- `image_captioning_project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with model training and results.
- `image_captioning_model.h5`: Saved trained model.
- `train_image_features.pkl`: InceptionV3 pre-extracted image features.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.

## Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook to see training, evaluation, and results.
3. Optionally fine-tune on expert-annotated captions for better performance.

## ðŸ’¾ Trained Model Download
The trained model file (`image_captioning_model.h5`) is too large for GitHub, so you can download it from this link:
